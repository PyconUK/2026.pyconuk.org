# 2026.pyconuk.org

Sadly we've been unable to find a Conference Director, so there won't be a PyCon UK 2026. We intend to put together a grants program to support alternative / more local events in its place.

If you are interested in being part of the organising team (or indeed, Conference Director!) for 2027, please contact kristian.glass@uk.python.org
